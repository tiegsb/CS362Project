For the tests that completed without errors, gcov reported ~40% line execution coverage.  This means that the tests are sometimes executing all of their code, and that the number of iterations per test is high enough to cover about half of the code branches.

The makefile rule "unittestresults.out" can be used to run all the tests created for this assignment.  It will make sure all tests are compiled (as well as the dominion code they depend on) and then run them, also returning the gcov line execution coverage results if possible.  All results are placed into the file "unittestresults.out".
