Project part a:


#Explain testIsValid()
#* How many URLs it is testing
#* How is it building the URLs
#* Give example of a valid URL being tested
#* Give example of a non valid URL being tested.


testIsValid() works by iterating over permutations of the arrays testUrlScheme, testUrlAuthority, testUrlPort, testPath, and 
testUrlQuery that contain ResultPair objects, which store a string containing a URL component and a boolean variable that is true
if the component is valid or false if not. testIsValid() iteratively assembles these components into URL strings. Each assembled
string is passed to the URLValidator.isValid() method. If all components of a test URL are valid, it expects isValid() to return true,
and otherwise it expects false. This tests a total of 31920 URL strings. 


An example of a valid URL it tests is
 http://www.google.com:80/test1?action=view. 


An invalid URL it tests is
 ://:65a/test1//file.


#Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator’s testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card 
#tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts and complexity)? Explain in a few lines.


This test is substantially similar to the tests we wrote in class. It makes use of input domain partitioning to find possibles errors in 
URLValidator. It is not a random tester, but it does effectively generate tests for a predefined domain (the permutations of given URL 
components).  One major difference is that this test only checks the return value of the isValid() function, whereas in the unit test we 
had to check not only the return value of the function, but also other changes it made to the gameState.
